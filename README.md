Title: Interaction with Beat wireless Headphone
Teng Xiong

When I first bought a Beats Studio 3 wireless headphone, I could not figure out how to connect to the device. I can see that there a power button and a power charge socket where you can plug in the power cord to charge the device, but there no volume buttons or any other button at all. The very first time I used the device, I did not know how to connect to it because it is a wireless headphone with no button indicate to connect wireless. There is no sign or symbol on the device to indicate where those buttons are. 

After I am playing around and read the manual, I found out that there are many buttons that I did not notice because there is no indicator for it. To connect to the device, I will have to press the same button as the power button and wait 3-5 seconds for the light to flash and blink. When the all the light is blinking, it means that it is searching for available Bluetooth connection in the area to connect to. It is a learnable process because after couple of tried, you will memorize the process and connect to it easily but again for a first-time user, it takes sometimes to figure it out. The Headphone itself is a very Satisfying device for entertainment because of the sound quality it produces and the hours of use the battery can provide. Once you know how to operate it, then it is a useful device for your cell phone and other voice purpose that you can use it for. 

I think that if there are at least symbol or sign indicating where to push for the functionality on the headset itself will help the headset to be more user friendly. Example like the plus (+) sign and the minus (-) sign will help the user to know where to press for increase and decrease volume. Even thought you created a very good quality device (headset), but if itâ€™s not user friendly it will dis-attract some user who do not know how to use it.

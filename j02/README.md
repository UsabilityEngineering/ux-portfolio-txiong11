## No indication of how to scroll left or right on Adobe XD

Adobe XD
What is Adobe XD? 
* Built from the ground up with performance top of mind, Adobe XD helps you craft prototypes that look and feel like the real thing, so you can communicate your design vision and maintain alignment across your team efficiently. 

* Adobe XD is a powerful and easy-to-use vector-based experience design platform that gives teams the tools they need to craft the world’s best experiences collaboratively. 

User friendliness shouldn’t be an issue with software that is used to help solve another issue when doing team collaboration. Ease of use of the software will help to solve problems faster and more effectively. When I used Adobe XD, I noticed that if you want to scroll the page up and down. You just scroll your the scroll wheel on your mouse, but still, there is no indicator on the Adobe XD software like a scroll bar. From past experience tell to use the scroll wheel on the mouse. But I have no idea how to scroll to the left or right, since there is not indicator or a bar on the bottom to scroll from left to right.

Since all of the mice that I have used in the past didn’t have the functionality of tilting scroll wheel left or right. This is my first time using Adobe XD, so I didn't know that this software have such feature.

So, in order for me to see the whole diagram in my screen. I have to zoom out until the whole diagram fits in the screen. The only problem is that, it’s too small to be able to edit or read it now.

Doing a quick search around for a good of 10 minutes and asked my teammates for hint in order to figure it out that you can scroll to left and right by tilting the scroll wheel on the mouse to the left and right. But if your mice didn’t have that feature in the scroll wheel, then you pretty much can’t move the page to left or right. As a new user, I did not find this feature learnable.

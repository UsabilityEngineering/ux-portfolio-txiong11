## No indication of how to scroll left or right on Adobe XD

Adobe XD
What is Adobe XD? 
* Built from the ground up with performance top of mind, Adobe XD helps you craft prototypes that look and feel like the real thing, so you can communicate your design vision and maintain alignment across your team efficiently. 

* Adobe XD is a powerful and easy-to-use vector-based experience design platform that gives teams the tools they need to craft the world’s best experiences collaboratively. 

User friendly shouldn’t be an issue with software that is used to help solve another issue when doing team collaboration. Ease of use of the software will help to solve problems faster and more effectively. When I used Adobe XD, I noticed automatically that if you want to scroll the page up and down. You just scroll your the scroll wheel on your mouse, but still, there is no indication on the Adobe XD software like a scroll bar. I can tell by past experience to use the scroll wheel on the mouse. But I have no idea how to scroll to the left or right.

Since some of the mouses that I had used didn’t have the functionality to tilted to the left or right with their scroll wheel.

In order for me to see the whole diagram in one screen. I have to zoom out until the whole diagram fits in the program screen. Then the problem is, it’s too small to be able to edit or read it.

So, I have to search around for a good of 10 minutes and asked my teammates for hint in order to figure it out that you can actually tilted the scroll wheel on the mouse to the left(side) and right(side) to move it to the left or right. But if your mice didn’t have that feature, then you pretty much can’t move the page to left or right. Unless you know another way that I didn’t know.

## No indication of how to scroll left or right on Adobe XD

Adobe XD
What is Adobe XD? 
* Built from the ground up with performance top of mind, Adobe XD helps you craft prototypes that look and feel like the real thing, so you can communicate your design vision and maintain alignment across your team efficiently. 

* Adobe XD is a powerful and easy-to-use vector-based experience design platform that gives teams the tools they need to craft the world’s best experiences collaboratively. 

User friendly shouldn’t be an issue with software that is used to help solve another issue like team collaboration. Ease of use will help to solve problems faster and more effectively. When I use Adobe XD, I notice automatically that if you want to scroll the page up and down. You just scroll your the scroll wheel on your mouse, but still, there is no indication on the Adobe XD software like a scroll bar. When I tried to scroll up and down, I can tell by past experience to use the scroll wheel on the mouse. But I have no idea how to scroll to the left or right.

Since some of the mouses didn’t have the functionality to scroll left or right with their scroll wheel.

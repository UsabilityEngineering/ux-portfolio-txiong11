Beat wireless headphones is such a good quality headphone with many great features, but being a first-time user of the headphone, its quite complicated. Figuring out the feature of the headphone and how to use it is sometime annoying. 

The power button has no sign, just a little circle button. When the headphone is not on, you just see a little dented black circle button and when it on, it has a little light in the center of that button. But there is no indication that the button is the power button, usually the power button has a standard symbol like in the second image.
